            <h3>3. Our Role as a Data Processor</h3>
            <p>
                As part of our services offered, we act as a Data Processor on behalf of our clients 
                (known as Data Controllers). This means that we might process personal data as provided 
                by our clients that you have voluntarily provided. In the event of personal data possession 
                provided by the client, it will be strictly processed in accordance to the instructions
                    provided by our clients and in compliance with applicable data protection laws, such as 
                    the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), 
                    where relevant.
            </p>
            <p>As a Data Processor, we are committed to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Processing Data as Instructed: We only process personal data on behalf of and as directed 
                    by our clients. The types of personal data we may process and the purposes for which it is 
                    processed are determined by our clients.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Data Security: We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the 
                    security, confidentiality, and integrity of personal data, protecting it against unauthorized 
                    or unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction, or damage.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Subprocessors: If we engage third-party service providers (subprocessors) to assist in the 
                    processing of personal data, we ensure they comply with similar data protection obligations. 
                    A current list of subprocessors can be made available to clients upon request.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Data Retention: We will retain personal data only for as long as instructed by our clients 
                    or as required to comply with legal obligations, after which the data will be securely 
                    deleted or returned.
                </li>
                <li>
                    International Data Transfers: Where applicable, we may transfer personal data across borders 
                    for processing, but we ensure that appropriate safeguards, such as Standard Contractual 
                    Clauses (SCCs), are in place to protect data in compliance with relevant laws.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Assisting with Data Subject Rights: While we do not directly interact with data subjects 
                    (individuals whose data we process), we assist our clients, when requested, in fulfilling 
                    their obligations regarding data subject rights such as access, correction, deletion, or 
                    portability of personal data.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Our responsibilities as a Data Processor are defined in contractual agreements with our clients, 
                which outline the scope of processing activities and compliance with relevant data protection regulations.
